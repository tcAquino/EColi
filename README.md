# EColi

Deposition and resuspension model for the dynamics of E. coli and other solutes and particulates in river and stream reaches, based on a continuous time random walk formulation of residence times.

The include directory can be included and used in separate projects without need for precompilation.

A frontend with several model options is provided along with test example parameters.

## Dependencies

A C++ distribution, including a compiler compatible with C++17, is required (for example, an up-to-date version of the gnu compiler collection gcc will do). All other libraries are header-only and provided.

## Documentation

See the manual file Manual.pdf in the man directory for further details and help or contact Tomás Aquino.
